# Herobrine-AI
Both fabric,forge

The Herobrine AI Mod brings a mysterious presence into your Minecraft world that doesn’t just appear… it interacts. Powered by intelligent behavior systems, Herobrine can watch, move, build, and — sometimes — even talk.

But here’s the twist:
You never know which version of him you’re going to get.

Sometimes, messages appear in chat:

“You shouldn’t be here.”
“I saw what you built.”
“Turn around.”

Other times… he’s different.

“Nice house.”
“Be careful in caves.”
“I’ll help… this time.”

The AI studies how you play. If you explore a lot, you might spot him standing far away, just watching. If you stay in one place too long, strange structures might appear nearby. If you mine deep underground, you may hear footsteps… or get a warning in chat right before danger.

He can be unsettling, helpful, curious, or completely silent for days. That’s what makes it terrifying — and fascinating. You start wondering:

Is he protecting you?
Is he playing with you?
Or is he just waiting?
